# 📈 Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning
     https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Lg6vxC8ksW2rt2oEYaYzICgABBE2m9x-?usp=sharing
## 📘 Overview
This project aims to **predict stock prices** using **historical market data** and **machine learning models**.  
The model identifies short-term trends and patterns in the stock market to assist in data-driven trading or analysis.  

---

## 🧩 Features
- Data collection and preprocessing using **Pandas** and **NumPy**  
- Data visualization using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  
- Implementation of **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** for time series forecasting  
- Scalable architecture for multiple stock tickers  
- Evaluation metrics: **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **R² Score**
